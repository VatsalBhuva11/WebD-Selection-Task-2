Let's have a look at the different functionalities of the website, and how to use them.

<h3> User Requests </h3>
<li><ins>Logout</ins>: Nothing to do; click on the send option to log out from the currently logged in user.</li>

<li><ins>View profile</ins>: This lets you view the profile information of any user. It does not require for you to be logged in. Type in the username of the user who's profile you want to view under the "Params" tab, not the "Body" tab like we've been doing so far.
</li><br>

<li><ins>Follow request:</ins> Want to make friends? Follow them up! Following a user lets you see their posts in your feed. Enter their username in the "Params" tab to follow them.
</li><br>

<li><ins>Unfollow request:</ins> Same functionality as the Follow feature.
</li><br>

<li><ins>Update user password:</ins> Didn't I tell you to remember your password? No worries, got your back. Head over to this request to change your password. The new password should be entered as the value to the password attribute under the "Body -> x-www-urlencoded" tab.
</li><br>

![image](/assets/screenshots/update-password.png)

<li><ins>Update user bio:</ins> Let others get to know more about you through your bio! Update your bio using this request, and showcase your specs!
</li><br>

<li><ins>Update profile pic:</ins> Haven't seen me yet? View my profile pic! Under the "Body -> form-data" section, select the profile pic that you want to upload!
</li><br>

<strong>Note: the profile won't be visible as this is just the backend part. The image can, however, be rendered using frontend as the image's relative path is stored in the database. The same applies to viewing a user's posts as well.</strong>

<h3> Post Requests </h3>

<li><ins>Create post:</ins> Share where you've been this summer or your outing with your friends and much more! Head over to the "Body -> form-data" section, and select the image/video that you want to post! Don't forget to add a suitable magical caption to captivate your followers!

Copy the inner text (don't copy the ObjectID part) and paste it in the postID attribute.
